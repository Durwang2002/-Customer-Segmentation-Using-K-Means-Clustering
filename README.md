# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on identifying distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior using **K-Means Clustering**. Businesses can use the insights generated to target marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and personalize services.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to segment customers into different groups based on their annual income and spending score using unsupervised machine learning (clustering). The **K-Means Clustering** algorithm is applied to a customer dataset to understand patterns in spending behavior.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project is the **Mall Customer Segmentation Data**. It includes:

- **CustomerID**: Unique ID for each customer
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Age**: Customer’s age
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income in thousands
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
